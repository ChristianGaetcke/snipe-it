# Snipe-IT Rest Api Clients


These clients were created out of lazyness and "cost efficiency" (read: stingyness), as I didn't want to manually inventorize the assets we already had and
I was not willing to pay for intunes or a similar solution, so this was the most reasonable approach.

## Getting Started

YouÂ´ll obviously need a working Snipe-IT installation and an API key. 
This will not be in the scope of this document, but there are some great tutorials
on how to get Snipe-IT running in Docker (https://snipe-it.readme.io/docs/docker).

### Prerequisites

The Windows10 client is pure powershell and uses forms (with a Base64 encoded Icon).
You don't need to add any modules, as it uses only existing Powershell commands.

For the OSX client, it is strongly advised to use Pashua (https://github.com/BlueM/Pashua - great work of @BlueM) 
and Playtpus (https://github.com/sveinbjornt/Platypus - great work of @sveinbjornt) to create an app out of the code.


```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
