### Building the OSX Client

### OSX client

Download [Platypus](https://github.com/sveinbjornt/Platypus) and [Pashua](https://github.com/BlueM/Pashua). 

## Deployment

The Windows client should include the helper.bat to bypass the execution-policy, as most Windows installations will have a restricted execution policy. Just zip both files into a folder
and let the users unzip it to the desktop and run helper.bat. They'll get a prompt for insecure software. This can be bypassed by adding a valid certificate, which was beyond the scope of this project.

## Some notes on the code

The code is far from perfect or optimized, but should serve as an inspiration for people who want to try out Snipe-IT or just want to do their inventorization and don't have the necessary environment.

* [Snipe-IT](https://snipeitapp.com/)
